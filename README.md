# FigureSampleV4
__Scientific figure data extraction software__<br>
*VERSION: 0.1*
<br>

FigureSampelV4 allows to "sample" a given (scientific) data visualization aka. a "plot" and converts the image back to a dataset containing numbers.
I started this project as part of my work as a research assistant with version 1 and soon after 2.
Although version 2 was quite popular with my colleagues, version 3 was discontinued by my boss.
Therefore I started version 4 as a hobby project, I work on in my free time.
To avoid legal problems version 4 does not use any code used by previous version!


Right now it is my plan to progress further and surpass the work I did in the past.
At the moment there is no roadmap I follow, but I plan to soon write one and add it to this repository.
Further it is my plan to write a short user manual in LaTeX.


I am highly interested in feedback and open for new ideas and any advice you want to give me!
Feel free to look at my code and use it!
